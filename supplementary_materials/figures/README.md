# Figures

This directory contains supplementary figures referenced in the manuscript.

## Organization

Each figure should be in its own subdirectory when multiple files are associated with it:

```
figures/
├── supplementary_fig_S1/
│   ├── figure_S1.png
│   ├── figure_S1.pdf
│   └── README.md
└── supplementary_fig_S2/
    ├── figure_S2.png
    └── figure_S2.pdf
```

## File Formats

Provide figures in multiple formats when possible:
- **PNG** - For web viewing and presentations (300 dpi minimum)
- **PDF** - For publication quality
- **SVG** - For vector graphics (editable)
- **TIFF** - For journal submission if required

## Naming Convention

- `supplementary_fig_S1.png`
- `supplementary_fig_S2.pdf`

## Figure Documentation

Each figure subdirectory should include a README describing:
- Figure caption
- What the figure shows
- Code used to generate the figure
- Data files used

## Resolution Guidelines

- Minimum 300 dpi for publication
- High resolution (600 dpi) for complex figures
- Vector formats (PDF, SVG) preferred for line plots and diagrams
